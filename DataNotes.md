# Data Notes

## TRU Call Data
*Questions:*

Why would a CFS be cleared RR but then a report not show in crime_data? There are 38 acquaintance rape CFSs that indicate a report was written, but only 31 of those calls are show in crime_data dataset.

*Possible Pathways:*

Should I pull crime_data with call types for rape and go back and find their CFS? A way to locate calls that ended up being for rape but were not initially reported as such.

*Observations:*

A lot of the rapes (in CFS) had crime categories changed to Sex offense - other, indecent liberties



## Narative
Even in this post-#MeToo world, coming forward to report a rape can still be a courageous act of bravery as victims battle feelings of shame, fear, vulnerability and more. Some victims have held in the stories of their assaults for weeks, months, years and - sometimes - a lifetime. Insert a a case example of someone who had waited a long time to finally report.
